# WanSoundTrajectory dependencies
#
# This package uses only basic numpy functions that have existed since ~1.0
# However, pinning numpy versions is notoriously dangerous - it can conflict
# with other packages, CUDA versions, or ComfyUI itself.
#
# ComfyUI already requires numpy, so you should be fine.
# If something breaks, it's probably not numpy's fault.

# numpy>=1.15.0
